 * It is useful to store images, large files, or text files that are not supposed to be preprocessed by WCM. <br />
 * For example: .pdf, .doc, .jpg, .png can be BinaryDocument, <br />
 * also large text files as .css/.js that WCM only have to serve them as resource. <br />
 * <br/>
 * Text content representation that would have a high maintenance by writers should be represented as {@link WCMTextDocument}
